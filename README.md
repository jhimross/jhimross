<h1>â˜• Welcome to my GitHub â˜•</h1>
	<p>Hello there, fellow caffeine addicts! I'm Jhimross, a coffee-loving developer who enjoys coding, learning new things, and of course, drinking coffee. Let me show you around my Github profile, and feel free to grab a cup of coffee while you're here.</p>
	<h2>ðŸš€ Current Brew</h2>
	<p>Right now, I'm sipping on Arabica beans coffee, which is the perfect fuel for my coding adventures. I'm also working on something, where I'm using my coding skills to make the world a better place.</p>
